  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the validity of the Arabic version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) in 149 illicit drug users.
METHODS: We calculated α coefficient, inter-item and item-total correlations, coefficients of reproducibility and scalability (CR and CS), item difficulty and discrimination indices.
RESULTS: The DASS-21 had an acceptable reliability; but values of the CR and the CS were less than acceptable. Items varied in difficulty and discrimination; some items are candidates for elimination.
CONCLUSION: The DASS-21 is a probabilistic and not a deterministic measure of distress; it has problematic items and needs further investigations.},

  abstract = {A novel fully disposable microfluidic electrochemical array device (µFED) was developed and successfully applied for detection of the biomarker estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). The µFED was constructed using low-cost materials and an inexpensive home cutter printer enabled the manufacture of dozens of µFEDs in less than 2h, at a cost of less than US$ 0.20 in material per device. The µFED incorporates counter and reference electrodes and eight carbon-based working electrodes, which were modified with DNA sequences known as estrogen response elements (DNA-ERE), where ERα binds specifically. Paramagnetic particles heavily decorated with anti-ERα antibody and horseradish peroxidase (MP-Ab-HRP) were used to efficiently capture ERα from the sample solution. The ERα-MP-Ab-HRP bioconjugate formed was injected into the µFED and incubated with the DNA-ERE-modified electrodes, followed by amperometric detection with application of -0.2V vs. Ag|AgCl while a mixture of H2O2 and hydroquinone was injected into the microfluidic device. An ultralow limit of detection of 10.0 fg mL(-1) was obtained with the proposed method. The performance of the assay, in terms of sensitivity and reproducibility, was studied using undiluted calf serum, and excellent recoveries in the range of 94.7-108% were achieved for the detection of ERα in MCF-7 cell lysate. The µFED system can be easily constructed and applied for multiplex biomarker detection, making the device an excellent cost-effective alternative for cancer diagnosis, especially in developing countries.},

  abstract = {Mass transfer in biofilms is determined by diffusion. Different mostly invasive approaches have been used to measure diffusion coefficients in biofilms, however data on heterogeneous biomass under realistic conditions is still missing. To non-invasively elucidate fluid-structure-interactions in complex multispecies biofilms pulsed field gradient-nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR) was applied to measure the water diffusion in five different types of biomass aggregates: one type of sludge flocs, two types of biofilm, and two types of granules. Data analysis is an important issue when measuring heterogeneous systems and is shown to significantly influence the interpretation and understanding of water diffusion. With respect to numerical reproducibility and physico-chemical interpretation, different data processing methods were explored: (bi)-exponential data analysis and the Γ distribution model. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficient distribution in relation to relaxation was studied by D-T2 maps obtained by 2D inverse Laplace transform (2D ILT). The results show that the effective diffusion coefficients for all biofilm samples ranged from 0.36 to 0.96 relative to that of water. NMR diffusion was linked to biofilm structure (e.g. biomass density, organic and inorganic matter) as observed by magnetic resonance imaging and to traditional biofilm parameters: Diffusion was most restricted in granules with compact structures, and fast diffusion was found in heterotrophic bio-films with fluffy structures. The effective diffusion coefficients in the biomass were found to be broadly distributed because of internal biomass heterogeneities, such as gas bubbles, precipitates, and locally changing biofilm densities. Thus, estimations based on biofilm bulk properties in multispecies systems can be overestimated and mean diffusion coefficients might not be sufficiently informative to describe mass transport in biofilms and the near bulk.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: In this article, we evaluate a plastic scintillation detector system for quality assurance in proton therapy using a BC-408 plastic scintillator, a commercial camera, and a computer.
METHODS: The basic characteristics of the system were assessed in a series of proton irradiations. The reproducibility and response to changes of dose, dose-rate, and proton energy were determined. Photographs of the scintillation light distributions were acquired, and compared with Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations and with depth-dose curves measured with an ionization chamber. A quenching effect was observed at the Bragg peak of the 60 MeV proton beam where less light was produced than expected. We developed an approach using Birks equation to correct for this quenching. We simulated the linear energy transfer (LET) as a function of depth in Geant4 and found Birks constant by comparing the calculated LET and measured scintillation light distribution. We then used the derived value of Birks constant to correct the measured scintillation light distribution for quenching using Geant4.
RESULTS: The corrected light output from the scintillator increased linearly with dose. The system is stable and offers short-term reproducibility to within 0.80%. No dose rate dependency was observed in this work.
CONCLUSIONS: This approach offers an effective way to correct for quenching, and could provide a method for rapid, convenient, routine quality assurance for clinical proton beams. Furthermore, the system has the advantage of providing 2D visualization of individual radiation fields, with potential application for quality assurance of complex, time-varying fields.},

This study aims at evaluating an in-house developed DIBH system. Free-breathing (FB) and DIBH plans were generated for 22 left-sided localized breast cancer patients who had radiation therapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery. All patients were treated utilizing an in-house laser distance measuring system. 50 Gy was prescribed, and parameters of interest were target coverage, left anterior descending coronary artery, (LAD) and heart doses. Portal images were acquired and the reproducibility and stability of DIBH treatment were compared to FB. The comparing result shows there is a significant reduction in all LAD and heart dose statistics for DIBH compared to FB plans without compromising the target coverage. The maximum LAD dose was reduced from 43.7 Gy to 29.0 Gy and the volume of the heart receiving >25 Gy was reduced from 3.3% to 1.0% using the in-house system, both statistically significant. The in-house system gave a reproducible and stable DIBH treatment where the systematic error ∑, and random error σ, were less than 2.2 mm in all directions, but were not significantly better than at FB.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the diagnostic performance of mean apparent diffusion coefficient (mADC) in differentiating benign from malignant bone spine tumors, using histology as a reference standard. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences have good reliability in evaluating spinal bone tumors, although some features of benign and malignant cancers may overlap, making the differential diagnosis challenging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 116 patients (62 males, 54 females; mean age 59.5 ± 14.1) with biopsy-proven spinal bone tumors were studied. Field strength/sequences: 1.5T MR system; T1 -weighted turbo spin-echo (repetition time / echo time [TR/TE], 500/13 msec; number of excitations [NEX], 2; slice thickness, 4 mm), T2 -weighted turbo spin-echo (TR/TE, 4100/102 msec; NEX, 2; slice thickness, 4 mm), short tau inversion recovery (TR/TE, 4800/89 msec; NEX, 2; slice thickness, 4 mm, IT, 140 msec), axial spin-echo echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (TR/TE 5200/72 msec; slice thickness 5 mm; field of view, 300; interslice gap, 1.5 mm; NEX, 6; echo-planar imaging factor, 96; no parallel imaging) with b-values of 0 and 1000 s/mm², and 3D fat-suppressed T1 -weighted gradient-recalled-echo (TR/TE, 500/13 msec; slice thickness, 4 mm) after administration of 0.2 ml/kg body weight gadolinum-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. Two readers manually drew regions of interest on the solid portion of the lesion (hyperintense on T2 -weighted images, hypointense on T1 -weighted images, and enhanced after gadolinium administration on fat-suppressed T1 -weighted images) to calculate mADC. Histology was used as the reference standard. Tumors were classified into malignant primary tumors (MPT), bone metastases (BM), or benign primary tumors (BPT). Statistical tests: Nonnormality of distribution was tested with the Shapiro-Wilk test. The Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-test with Bonferroni correction were used. Sensitivity and specificity of the mADC values for BM, MPT, and BPT were calculated. Approximate receiver operating characteristic curves were created. Interobserver reproducibility was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).
RESULTS: The mADC values of MPT (n = 35), BM (n = 65), and BPT (n = 16) were 1.00 ± 0.32 (0.59-2.10) × 10(-3) mm(2) /s, 1.02 ± 0.25 (0.73-1.96) × 10(-3) mm(2) /s, 1.31 ± 0.36 (0.83-2.14) × 10(-3) mm(2) /s, respectively. The mADC was significantly different between BPT and all malignant lesions (BM+MPT) (P < 0.001), BM and BPT (P = 0.008), and MPT and BPT (P = 0.008). No difference was found between BM and MPT (P = 0.999). An mADC threshold of 0.952 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s yielded 81.3% sensitivity, 55.0% specificity. Accuracy was 76% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 63.9%-88.1%). Interobserver reproducibility was almost perfect (ICC = 0.916; 95% CI = 0.879-0.942).
CONCLUSION: DWI with mADC quantification is a reproducible tool to differentiate benign from malignant solid tumors with 76% accuracy. The mADC values of BPT were statistically higher than that of malignant tumors. However, the large overlap between cases may make mADC not helpful in a specific patient.

Two teams independently applied the two-stage framework on mechanisms underpinning the association between body fatness and breast cancer to test the framework feasibility and reproducibility as part of a WCRF-Commissioned validation study. In Stage 1, a "hypothesis-free" approach was used to provide an overview of potential intermediate mechanisms between body fatness and breast cancer. Dissimilar rankings of potential mechanisms were observed between the two teams due to different applications of the framework. In Stage 2, a systematic review was conducted on the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor chosen as intermediate mechanism. Although the studies included differed, both teams found inconclusive evidence for the body fatness-IGF1R association and modest evidence linking IGF1R to breast cancer, therefore concluded that there is currently weak evidence for IGF1R as mechanism linking body fatness to breast cancer. The framework is a good starting point for conducting systematic review by integrating evidence from mechanistic studies on exposure-cancer associations. Based on our experience, we provide recommendations for future users.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Radical prostatectomy (RP) is one of the most complex urological procedures performed. Higher surgical volume has been found previously to be associated with better patient outcomes and reduced costs to the health care system. This has resulted in some regionalization of care toward high-volume facilities and providers; however, the preponderance of RPs is still performed at low-volume institutions.
OBJECTIVE: To provide an updated systematic review of the association of hospital and surgeon volume on patient and system outcomes after RP, including robot-assisted RP.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review of literature was undertaken, searching PubMed (1959-2016) for original articles. Selection criteria included RP, hospital and/or surgeon volumes as predictor variables, categorization of hospital and/or surgeon volumes, and measurable end points.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Overall 49 publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies demonstrated that higher-volume surgeries are associated with better outcomes including reduced mortality, morbidity, postoperative complications, length of stay, readmission, and cost-associated factors. The volume-outcome relationship is maintained in robotic surgery. Eleven studies assessed hospital and surgeon volume simultaneously, and findings reflect that neither is an independent predictor variable affecting outcomes. The studies varied in how volume cutoffs were categorized as well as how the volume-outcome relationship was methodologically evaluated.
CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary evidence continues to support the relationship between high-volume surgeries with improved RP outcomes. Recent studies demonstrate that the volume-outcome relationship applies to robot-assisted RP and may be applied for potential cost savings in health care. An increase in the number of international studies suggests reproducibility of the association. Although regionalization of surgical care remains a contentious issue, there is an increasing body of evidence that short-term outcomes are improved at high-volume centers for RP.
PATIENT SUMMARY: This systematic review of the latest literature found that higher surgical volume was associated with improved outcomes for radical prostatectomy.},

  abstract = {Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an important porcine bacterial pathogen and emerging zoonotic agent mainly responsible for sudden death, septic shock, and meningitis. However, serotype 2 strains are genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous. Though a multitude of virulence factors have been described for S. suis serotype 2, the lack of a clear definition regarding which ones are truly "critical" has created inconsistencies that have only recently been highlighted. Herein, the involvement of two factors previously described as being critical for S. suis serotype 2 virulence, whether the dipeptidyl peptidase IV and autolysin, were evaluated with regards to different ascribed functions using prototype strains belonging to important sequence types. Results demonstrate a lack of reproducibility with previously published data. In fact, the role of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV and autolysin as critical virulence factors could not be confirmed. Though certain in vitro functions may be ascribed to these factors, their roles are not unique for S. suis, probably due to compensation by other factors. As such, variations and discrepancies in experimental design, including in vitro assays, cell lines, and animal models, are an important source of differences between results. Moreover, the use of different sequence types in this study demonstrates that the role attributed to a virulence factor may vary according to the S. suis serotype 2 strain background. Consequently, it is necessary to establish standard experimental designs according to the experiment and purpose in order to facilitate comparison between laboratories. Alongside, studies should include strains of diverse origins in order to prevent erroneous and biased conclusions that could affect future studies.},

Materials and Methods This was a HIPAA-compliant institutional review board-approved study, with informed consent from patients. Dose-reduced spiral unenhanced lung EID and PCD CT examinations were performed in 30 asymptomatic volunteers in accordance with manufacturer-recommended guidelines for CT lung cancer screening (120-kVp tube voltage, 20-mAs reference tube current-time product for both detectors). Quantitative analysis of images included measurement of mean attenuation, noise power spectrum (NPS), and lung nodule contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Images were qualitatively analyzed by three radiologists blinded to detector type. Reproducibility was assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). McNemar, paired t, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare image quality. Results Thirty study subjects were evaluated (mean age, 55.0 years ± 8.7 [standard deviation]; 14 men). Of these patients, 10 had a normal body mass index (BMI) (BMI range, 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2); group 1), 10 were overweight (BMI range, 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2); group 2), and 10 were obese (BMI ≥30.0 kg/m(2), group 3). PCD diagnostic quality was higher than EID diagnostic quality (P = .016, P = .016, and P = .013 for readers 1, 2, and 3, respectively), with significantly better NPS and image quality scores for lung, soft tissue, and bone and with fewer beam-hardening artifacts (all P < .001). Image noise was significantly lower for PCD images in all BMI groups (P < .001 for groups 1 and 3, P < .01 for group 2), with higher CNR for lung nodule detection (12.1 ± 1.7 vs 10.0 ± 1.8, P < .001). Inter- and intrareader reproducibility were good (all ICC > 0.800). Conclusion Initial human experience with dose-reduced PCD chest CT demonstrated lower image noise compared with conventional EID CT, with better diagnostic quality and lung nodule CNR.

METHODS: Models were created from pre-operative images for three patients using a standard radiology 3D workstation. Operating surgeons assessed model utility using the Gillespie scale (1 = inferior to 4 = superior), and accuracy compared to intraoperative findings. Model variability was assessed for one patient for whom two models were created independently. The models were compared subjectively by surgeons and quantitatively based on overlap of depicted tissues, and differences in tumor volume and proximity to tissues.
RESULTS: Models were superior to imaging and 3D visualization for surgical planning (mean score = 3.4), particularly for determining surgical approach (score = 4) and resectability (score = 3.7). Model accuracy was good to excellent. In the two models created for one patient, tissue volumes overlapped by >86.5%, and tumor volume and area of tissues ≤1 mm to the tumor differed by <15% and <1.8 cm(2) , respectively. Surgeons considered these differences to have negligible effect on surgical planning.

Notably, these perovskite films are deposited from pre-mixed perovskite solutions for facile one-step processing under room-temperature and ambient atmosphere. The CHP molecules result in the uniform and homogeneous perovskite films even in the one-step slot-die system, which originate from the high boiling point and low vapor pressure of CHP. Meanwhile, the DMSO molecules facilitate the growth of perovskite grains by forming intermediate states with the perovskite precursor molecules. Consequently, fully printed PeSC based on the binary additive system exhibits a high PCE of 12.56% with a high reproducibility.},

The INNA makes use of quantitative instruments, arising from the natural sciences as well as of qualitative ones, arising from the human achieving results of standardization and reproducibility, as well as of customization and uniqueness. Accordingly, the purpose of this work is to exemplify the thinking process of and the method adopted by a nurse adopting an integrated narrative assessment in the evaluation of a patient.
METHOD: The patient suffered from acute myeloid leukaemia, treated with chemotherapy. Her nurse worked in a haematology ward in a North Italy Hospital. The nurse had previous experience in conducting the assessment according to INNA. Based on patient's characteristics, the nurse chose to use the narration (to explore needs from their subjective perception) and the scales (to measure them objectively) among the various assessment instruments provided by the INNA.
RESULTS: The resultant integrated outcomes helped the nurse to have a comprehensive overview of the person's health-care needs and their connections. These outcomes derive from the integration of narrative information with those obtained from the scales, which in this paper have shown consistent results.
CONCLUSION: It is very difficult to reach this complexity by considering qualitative and quantitative assessment strategies as mutually foreclosing, given that both emerged as being very useful in identifying, understanding and measuring the needs of the assisted person. Then they both could be used to design a customized intervention, encouraging new connections between disease, illness, sickness and everyday life.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: While limited data suggest that the fecal microbiota in healthy people is stable over time, the intraindividual variability of the fecal microbiota in constipated patients is unknown.
METHODS: This study evaluated the intraindividual reproducibility of fecal microbiota analyzed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing in two stool samples collected without and after a laxative, respectively, in 25 healthy people and 25 constipated women. Participants completed a food record for 3 d before the stool collection. Colonic transit was measured with scintigraphy.
KEY RESULTS: The constipated patients were older (48±15 vs 39±10 y, P=.02) than healthy participants but had a similar BMI. The total daily caloric intake was less (P=.005) in constipated (1265±350 kcal) than healthy participants (1597±402 kcal). Fourteen patients but only two controls (P<.005), had delayed colonic transit. For most measures of alpha (eg, Observed OTU number, Shannon index) and beta diversity (eg, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, UniFrac, phyla level abundance), the ICCs between two stool samples were high, indicating moderate or strong agreement, and similar in healthy people and constipated patients. The ICC for the weighted UniFrac distance, which is weighted by abundance, was lower than its unweighted counterpart, indicating that the unweighted measure is more robust and reproducible.
CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: The intraindividual reproducibility of fecal microbiota in constipated patients is high and comparable to healthy participants. For most purposes, evaluating the fecal microbiota in a single stool sample should generally suffice in adequately powered studies of healthy and constipated patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postexercise heart rate recovery (HRR) is a non-invasive tool for cardiac autonomic function assessment. Reproducibility of HRR has been established in healthy subjects; however, no study has evaluated this reproducibility in clinical populations who may present autonomic dysfunction. Patients with peripheral artery disease and intermittent claudication (IC) often present altered cardiac autonomic function and HRR could be an interesting tool for evaluating autonomic responses to interventions in this population. Therefore, the reproducibility of HRR should be determined in this specific population.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the reproducibility of HRR indices in patients with IC.
METHODS: Nineteen men with IC underwent two repeated maximal treadmill tests. Raw HR and relative HRR (difference to exercise peak) indices measured at 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300s of recovery were evaluated. The presence of systematic bias was assessed by comparing test and retest mean values via paired t-test. Reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and agreement by typical error (TE), coefficient of variation (CV) and minimal detectable difference (MDD).
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the test and retest values of all raw HR and relative HRR indices (P ≥ 0·05), except for HR120s (P = 0·032). All indices exhibited excellent reliability (ICC ≥ 0·78). Raw HR and relative HRR indices showed TEs ≤ 6·4 bpm and MDDs ≤ 17·8 bpm. In addition, all indices showed CVs ≤ 13·2%, except HRR30s (CV = 45·6%).
CONCLUSIONS: The current results demonstrated that most HRR indices were highly reproducible with no systematic error, excellent reliability and good agreement in patients with IC following maximal graded exercise.},

  abstract = {Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has emerged as a powerful tool for in vivo assessments of cardiac parameters in experimental animal models of cardiovascular diseases, but its reproducibility in this setting remains poorly explored. To address this issue, we investigated the test-retest reproducibility of preclinical cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) at 7 Tesla in healthy C57BL/6 mice, including an analysis of the impact of different anesthetic procedures (isoflurane or pentobarbital). We also analyzed the intra-study reproducibility and the intra- and inter-observer post-processing reproducibility of CMR images. Test-retest reproducibility was high for left ventricular parameters, especially with the isoflurane anesthetic procedure, whereas right ventricular parameters and deformation measurements were less reproducible, mainly due to physiological variability. Post-processing reproducibility of CMR images was high both within and between observers. These results highlight that anesthetic procedures might influence CMR test-retest reproducibility, an important ethical consideration for longitudinal studies in rodent models of cardiomyopathy to limit the number of animals used.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To obtain reference values for the isometric endurance test (IET) of the cervical flexor muscles, investigate its reproducibility, and compare the results with the maximal isometric strength test (MIST) of the cervical flexor muscles.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional non-comparative study with single group repeated measurements.
METHODS: Altogether 219 healthy females aged 20-59 years volunteered to participate in the study. The IET was performed in the supine position and MIST seated. The reproducibility was evaluated by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and an analysis described by Bland and Altman. The relationship between the two measuring methods was evaluated by Pearson's correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) IET time was 60 (33) seconds with no significant differences between the age groups of each decade. The ICC for intrarater repeatability was 0.80. However, the Bland-Altman analysis suggested moderate variation in repeated measurements. Pearson's correlation coefficient between the IET and MIST was 0.56.
CONCLUSION: Normative reference values for the IET are presented. Although the ICC showed good repeatability, one should consider that the change at follow-up visits has to be considerable to be clinically relevant. The correlation between the endurance time and maximal flexion strength was moderate. Thus IET of the cervical flexor muscles may be used in the clinic like the Biering-Sorenson test has been used to assess fatigue of the trunk extensor muscles.},
